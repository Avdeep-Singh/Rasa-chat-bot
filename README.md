Rasa Chat Bot

1. First create the Python environment (I have used conda env with Python version 3.7.5 If using conda give environment.yml file to conda it will create the env automatically else check all the pip dependencies in the requirments.txt file)
2. After that install Rasa using this command:- pip install rasa
3. after installing rasa open the model folder select the model and paste it into the models folder where you installed rasa.
